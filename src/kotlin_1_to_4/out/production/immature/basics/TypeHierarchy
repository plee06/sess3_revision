In Kotlin, uppermost type -> Any, analogous to Object supertype in Java

Any defines toString, hashCode and equals. Also has other extension methods. Chapter 5, it's comign!

Unit type -> equivalent to void in Java

Nothing -> is new and is a "bottom type", opposite of Any. It is the subclass of all types!

Look into Nothing later a bit more ...
