/**
 * another standard library functionality: Let

 *

// Let is similar to apply
/*
* key difference: it doesn't return the instance like apply, instead, it returns the value of the
* closure itself (whatever it's closing over --> the value). useful when we want to execute some code on an object
* but return some different value and we don't need a reference to the original!
*
