// Most obvious, functions are defined with the fun keyword


fun helloSir() = "Hello Sir!"

// Format of fun functioName: ReturnType = Some functionality ...

/*
* In Kotlin, if a function doesn't return anything useful, think of Unit as void in Java
*
* Omission is possible, no type is same as Unit
