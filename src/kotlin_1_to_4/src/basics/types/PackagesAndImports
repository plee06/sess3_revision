Packages and Imports in Kotlin are the same as Java as well.

We use regular package somepackage.otherpackage ...

and basic import statements.

import somepackage.otherpackage

etc.etc.


And of course, don't forget wildcard imports i.e. "import the entire package."

Example:

import allofthispackage.*

Imports can be renamed if two different packages share the same name i.e.

import package1.foo
import package2.foo as foo2 <-- renaming of the package
