// What are we trying to do here?

/*
* We're trying to figure out what data classes are! At least at the most basic level ..
*
* The whole point of the data class is just to hold data.
*
* Think of a Class whose sole existence is to be instantiated as used as "data holder" but doesn't actually
* do anything, i.e. no mutating methods
*
