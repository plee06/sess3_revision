In Kotlin the return statement is similar to Java.


The thing with Kotlin though is that because we can nest functions in a "functional programming" way
the return will return out of the inner most function, i.e. the scope it is currently in.


Also, when it comes to closures like running a .forEach and testing for some condition, the return can have a label
with return@forEach or we can label the .forEach stop@

Refer to the documentation or Programming Kotlin book for more details.
